# balanced-minimum-sum-of-squares-clustering
This repository includes the source code of the proposed MA algorithm published in an Information Sciences paper titled with "Responsive threshold search based memetic algorithm for balanced minimum sum-of-squares clustering".

The 16 datasets used are available from the UCI machine learning repository (http://www.ics.uci.edu/mlearn/MLRepository.html). To facilitate the further research, we upload the 40 pmed instances from OR-LIB here.
